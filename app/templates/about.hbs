    <h1>About the Twin Cities community profile</h1>

    <p class="lead">This platform is a tool to help users compare and understand different information about neighborhoods and communities in Minnesota. The information is organized by city wards, neighborhoods, precincts and communities to explain different information related to population, education, and employment specifics.</p>

    <h2>Main Goal</h2>

    <p>Our main goal is to help users view the Minnesota community vulnerability index*. This is to help provide information to users whom we have framed as being policy makers, non-profit organizations and people who have influence on government level changes.</p>
    <p>*A vulnerability index is a measure of the exposure of a population to some hazard. Typically, the index is a composite of multiple quantitative indicators that via some formula, delivers a single numerical result.</p>
    <p>Our main goal is to help users understand the action they can take to change the negativity this data might show. We hope to help provide area specific data, while helping users personally connect with the information.</p>
    <h3>We have focused on 7 main data categories</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>No Health Insurance Coverage</li>
      <li>Education - High School or Higher</li>
      <li>Supplemental Security Income</li>
      <li>Gross Rent as a Percentage of Income â€“ Households Spending 35% or More</li>
      <li>Poverty</li>
      <li>Unemployment</li>
      <li>Disability</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How was this website made?</h3>
    <p>This was developed at the CodeSwitch event in St. Paul, Minnesota. The event was focused on creating tools and platforms to help the community under the themes of education, safety and inclusion. This application is to help educate users to improve the overall safety and inclusiveness of the city. The web app is an Ember.js application, forked from <a href="https://communityprofiles.planning.nyc.gov/">NYC Planning Labs Community District Profiles</a>.  The community vulnerability index was created using methodology created by <a href="https://cmo.smcgov.org/cvi">San Mateo County</a>.
